This is the messiest Python program I've ever written... :see_no_evil:
but I was young and needed the results quickly.


Some grammar rules (not enforced in code):

1. Root tensor may not have any parent connections
1. Node tensors must have exactly one parent connection marked with a `^`
1. Leaf indices are indicated by an empty value
